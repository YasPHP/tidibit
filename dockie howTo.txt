You use docker to launch
In this case you'd use docker-compose up
(you only have 1 configuration yml so it  knows to use that)
After that, if you need to execute commands inside the web container
Let's say manually running migrations
You use docker exec - it CONTAINER_NAME bash
I believe CONTAINER_NAME should be schooly_web


$ docker kill $(docker ps -q)
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
$ docker rmi $(docker images -q)
$ docker system prune - f
$ docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
$ docker-compose up
