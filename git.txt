When you have multiple branches:
-make sure you are working on the branch you want to commit and git push to
-> To do this on Pycharm, make sure you check out the local branch you want to work in 
-> The branch you are in cannot be different than the one you want to be in, unless you have merging in mind 

-It is best to make most changes in IDE and not in the online repository (ie.Github)
-> If you make changes online, make sure to Rebase so the local repository is updated accordingly
-> Make branches on IDE for ease
